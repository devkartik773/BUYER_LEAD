## üé® Design Notes

### Server vs. Client Components
- **Server Components:**  
  Used for `/buyers` list and dynamic `/buyers/[id]` pages ‚Äî enabling direct, secure DB queries with fast initial loads.

- **Server Actions:**  
  All form submissions (create, update, import) handled via Next.js Server Actions ‚Äî no separate API layer needed.

- **Client Components:**  
  Interactive components like `NewBuyerForm`, `SearchAndFilters`, and `ExportButton` run on the client.

### Validation Strategy
- **Double Validation:**  
  Using **Zod** on both client and server to ensure instant user feedback plus secure server-side validation before DB writes.

### Ownership & Safety
- Each lead is tied to an `ownerId`.
- Update actions include ownership checks to prevent unauthorized edits.
- Concurrency control using timestamps prevents conflicting updates.
